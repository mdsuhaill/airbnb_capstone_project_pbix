Airbnb Price & Scenario Analysis Dashboard
________________________________________
📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyse Airbnb listings in Antwerp. The dashboard helps property owners and stakeholders evaluate listing performance, price trends, and projected revenues under different scenarios — without relying on machine learning.

The solution enables users to:
•	Track average prices, availability, review counts, and projected revenue.

•	Explore scenario-based insights using What-If parameters for occupancy and seasonal multipliers.

•	Visualise listings through maps, price distributions, and trend charts.

•	Drill down into top-performing listings and review details.
